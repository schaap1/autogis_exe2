## Solution cells and test cells

#### Solution code cells
You can always start working by removing these two lines of comments/code: 

```
# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()
```
We are checking your solutions semi-automatically using [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) which is a package for creating and grading assingments in Jupyter Notebooks. Please use the suggested variable names when writing your code so that our hidden tests work smoothly :)

#### Non-editable code cells
Some of the code-cells are "non-editable" which means that you are supposed to run them, but you are not able to edit them. These Non-editable code cells should help you to test your code while you proceed.
